# How to contribute to ContosoTraders

This repo is a reference and learning resource and everyone is invited to contribute, however not all PRs will be accepted into the main branch (**`main`**).

There's a general development strategy that's driven by @marcusfelling, who chooses, or defines criteria for choosing, the issues to include in the codebase, given a bunch of constraints and other guidelines.

## Coding Standards

There are no explicit coding standards so pay attention to the general coding style, that's (mostly) used everywhere.

## Forks and Branches

All contributions must be submitted as a [Pull Request (PR)](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) so you need to [fork this repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) on your GitHub account.

The main branche is **`main`**:

- **`main`**: Contains the latest code **and it is the branch actively developed**.
**All PRs must be against `main` branch to be considered**.

- Any other branch is considered temporary and could be deleted at any time. Do not submit any PR to them!

## DISCLAIMER - This is not a PRODUCTION-READY TEMPLATE for microservices

ContosoTraders is a reference application to **showcase architectural patterns** for developing microservices applications using various Azure Services. **IT IS NOT A PRODUCTION-READY TEMPLATE** to start real-world application. In fact, the application is in a **permanent beta state**, as itâ€™s also used to test new potentially interesting technologies as they show up.

Since this is a learning resource, some design decisions have favored simplicity to convey a pattern, over production-grade robustness.

## Suggestions

We hope this helps us all to work better and avoid some of the problems/frustrations of working in such a large community.

We'd also appreciate any comments or ideas to improve this.
